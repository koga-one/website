after the storm passes 1<br/>
and the sun comes back 9<br/>
and my mind clears out t<br/>
i suddenly realize the h<br/>
meaning of my thoughts &nbsp<br/>
perhaps, perhaps i can f<br/>
be honest and tell her l<br/>
everything i've always o<br/>
wanted to share, maybe o<br/>
maybe, just maybe, she r<br/>
might understand these \_\_<br/>
things i've been trying c<br/>
to deal with for so long a<br/>
by myself. maybe she will r<br/>
help me and comfort me for e<br/>
hours, whispering in my ear f<br/>
i am here for you, don't cry u<br/>
you're not alone anymore, ok? l<br/>
whatever happens, just please, !<br/>
don't jump, don't ever give up. =|<br/>
don't jump::::::::::::::>-|o<br/>
don't jump::::::>-|o<br/>
