in the backstage, alone<br/>
helping,<br/>
trying my best.

it truly hurts to see them so happy<br/>
why? wasn't i the one responsible for this?<br/>
why can't i share some of the happiness that i gave them?

all these years, the reason for my constant and neverending will to help others<br/>
was it because i felt empty this whole time?<br/>
perhaps, just perhaps<br/>
all i needed this whole time<br/>
was someone to say<br/>
"i know what you're doing"<br/>
"i'm proud of you"<br/>
"i'm with you"<br/>
"you're not alone"
