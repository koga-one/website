i can't turn off my brain<br/>
for some reason, nothing's good enough today<br/>
they're too busy with their own lives<br/>
which is how it is supposed to happen<br/>
but why am i stuck<br/>
while everything moves?

am i the problem? am i doing something wrong? what should i do?

why am i feeling empty

why do i feel left out?
